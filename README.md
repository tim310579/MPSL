# Micro_Processor_System_Lab

## for lab1-8

1. some assembly's understanding, not difficult

2. like above, add some stack's problem

3. about GPIO and LED

4. use max7219 to display some numbers

5. something about keypad, can press keypad to display on max7219

6. learn how to adjust clock, PWM, timer's settings, to be crazy

7. like lab6, add interrupt and some frequency's adjustment, spend all weekend on it
